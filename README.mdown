# What's This
This is designed to be a drop-to-use Weibo Share-Only Utility.
The first Version is done.

# How to Use
1. Drag the ShareToCN/ShareToCN/ into your Xcode Project
2. If you just want the share-to-weibo functionality: 
    
    [ShareToCN shareText:text];

    //< Or
    
    [ShareToCN shareText:text withDelegate:delegate];

    //< pass in a delegate if you want the feedback.

    @protocol ShareToCNDelegate 

    - (void)shareFailedWithError:(NSError *)error;
    - (void)shareSucceed;

    @end

3. If you want a pop-out box to enter/edit the text:

    [ShareToCNBox showWithText:text];


Quite easy, right?

Thanks to JimLiu/WeiboSDK, and people who build some components I don't know where they come from, 
you can find their names at the top of the files.
